                    Zalgo Text is a distorted version of the normal text that looks like a scary.
                    Do you often see how people post bizarre transitioned texts that look uniquely styled? These texts
                    are portrayed
                    as part of memes or images,
                    some of which look nicely framed while some look very creepy.
                    They certainly are grabbing a lot of attention in various media platforms like Facebook, Instagram,
                    Twitter,
                    etc.
                    Many new versions of these texts are introduced every now and then. They are generally referred to
                    as “Zalgo
                    texts” or “Glitch Texts” due to their fleeting malfunction-like or messed-up appearance.
                    Following is one such example of a Zalgo text.

                <p>Character rendering of Unicode is not like other character encodings.
                    A simple character encoding allows glyphs to fit only in the specified height, unlike the Unicode.
                    The Unicode
                    standard provides a unique number for every character irrespective of the platform,
                    device or language.
                    It allows data to be transported between servers, devices,
                    and applications without any corruption or loss.
                    Considering that different written languages use a different set of characters,
                    Unicode came up with these unique set of marks called diacritics that could be added to any normal
                    text
                    explicitly.
                    These diacritics are a result
